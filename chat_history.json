**Technical Implementation**\n\n#### **Data Management**\n- **Service Layer** (`services/parliamentaryMembersService.ts`): Centralized data management\n- **Caching** (`utils/dataUpdateScheduler.ts`): Local storage with AsyncStorage\n- **Custom Hook** (`hooks/useParliamentaryMembers.ts`): React hook for data fetching\n\n#### **Components**\n- **MemberCard** (`components/MemberCard.tsx`): Reusable member display component\n- **SearchBar** (`components/SearchBar.tsx`): Enhanced search input with clear functionality\n- **AppInfo** (`components/AppInfo.tsx`): Comprehensive app information display\n\n#### **Types & Utilities**\n- **Type Definitions** (`types/ParliamentaryMember.ts`): TypeScript interfaces\n- **Common Styles** (`styles/commonStyles.ts`): Centralized styling with specified color scheme\n\n### \ud83d\udcca **Sample Data**\nThe app includes 15 sample parliamentary members representing:\n- **House of Representatives**: MPs from various electorates\n- **Senate**: Senators from all states and territories\n- **Multiple Parties**: Labor, Liberal, Greens, One Nation, Country Liberal, Independents\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 **Data Update System**\n- **Daily Updates**: Automatic check for data updates every 24 hours\n- **Manual Refresh**: Pull-to-refresh functionality\n- **Offline Support**: Cached data for offline viewing\n- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf **Key Features**\n1. **Real-time Search**: Instant filtering as you type\n2. **Contact Integration**: Direct email and phone contact options\n3. **Chamber Identification**: Clear distinction between House and Senate members\n4. **Party Color Coding**: Visual party identification\n5. **Electorate Information**: Detailed location and representation data\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 **Future Enhancements**\nThe app is designed to easily integrate with real APIs:\n- Replace mock data with actual Parliament House API\n- Add push notifications for parliamentary updates\n- Implement favorites/bookmarking system\n- Add more detailed member information (committees, voting records, etc.)\n\nThe app follows React Native best practices with proper separation of concerns, TypeScript for type safety, and a scalable architecture that can easily accommodate real-world data sources and additional features.\n\n**Note**: For live data integration, you would need to enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button and connecting to a project, then set up the appropriate database tables and API endpoints to fetch real parliamentary data."}, {"type":

Fetch and display data for Australian parliamentary senators, ministers, shadow ministers, and members from the Senate and House of Representatives.\n2.  Include details such as photo, full name, party, suburb, and portfolios.\n3.  Use data from the specified websites (aph.gov.au and pmc.gov.au).\n4.  Automatically check for and apply updates each time the app is opened.\n\nHere's a refined approach to achieve this:\n\n*   **Data Fetching and Parsing:** Implement a service (or update the existing `parliamentaryMembersService.ts`) to scrape and parse data from the provided websites. Consider using libraries like `axios` for fetching and `cheerio` or `react-native-html-parser` for parsing the HTML content. Be mindful of website terms of service and potential changes to the website structure.\n*   **Data Structure:** Ensure the `ParliamentaryMember` type definition (`types/ParliamentaryMember.ts`) includes all the required fields (photo URL, full name, party, suburb, portfolios).\n*   **Automatic Updates:** Implement a mechanism to check for updates when the app is opened. This could involve comparing a stored timestamp of the last update with a timestamp from the data source. Use `AsyncStorage` to store the timestamp and cached data.\n*   **UI Updates:** Modify the `MemberCard` component (`components/MemberCard.tsx`) to display the new data fields, including the member's photo.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle cases where data fetching or parsing fails. Use `utils/errorLogger.ts` to log any errors.\n*   **Background Updates:** For a smoother user experience, consider implementing background data fetching using `expo-background-fetch` or similar libraries. However, be aware of the limitations and battery implications of background tasks.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T23:17:11.874034"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you update your Australian parliamentary members app with enhanced data fetching capabilities.

Users can now easily filter parliamentary members by state/territory without having to open additional filter menus."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-04T23:26:38Z"}]
